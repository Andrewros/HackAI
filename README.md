Face Recognition Flask App
Description
This is a Flask-based web application that performs face recognition using RandomForestClassifier from scikit-learn. The app allows users to log in, register, train a model with images, and predict identities based on uploaded images.

Features
User Authentication: Register and login functionality with password hashing.

Image Preprocessing: Converts images to grayscale and resizes them for training.

RandomForest Classifier: Used to train a model for recognizing users.

Dataset Management: Users can add new classes and train the model dynamically.

Session Management: Uses Flask-Session to store user sessions.

SQLite Database: Stores user authentication data and class information.

Reset Functionality: Allows users to clear their training data.

Technologies Used
Python (Flask, OpenCV, NumPy, PIL)

Scikit-Learn (RandomForest, LabelEncoder)

SQLite Database

Flask-Session

Gunicorn (for Heroku deployment)
